Hi, I’m Paul Power (@paulpster)
I find SVG and mathematical driven graphics to be very intersting

I’m trying to create some projects to mess around with some math and SVG. I would like to do this in vue.js (V2/V3) and react. Sometime when I am feeling very entergetic, I will give angular a try. :)

I can be reached at paulpster at gmail dot com
